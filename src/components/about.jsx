          <strong>The Waterfront Law Center</strong> is located in the{" "}
          <strong>Waterfront Park Building</strong> in{" "}
          <strong>downtown Edmonds</strong>, next to the ferry terminal and
          other public transportation services. It provides a unique opportunity
          for <strong>sole-practitioners and small firms </strong>to provide
          client services provided by larger firms, at a fraction of the fixed
          costs associated with the traditional 24/7 law firm model. It is
          located <strong>18 miles north</strong> of the King County Courthouse
          in Seattle and <strong>17 miles south</strong> of the Snohomish County
          Courthouse in Everett.{" "}
          <strong>Regular ferry service within walking distance</strong> makes
          it possible for lawyers living on the Olympic peninsula to maintain a
          very cost-effective office in the Seattle metro area.

          Thanks to <strong>new electronic filing rules</strong>, it is no
          longer necessary to have an office in downtown Seattle. You can also{" "}
          <strong>avoid the costs and commitment</strong> of a long-term lease,
          furnishings, equipment, and a payroll. At the Waterfront Law Center,
          you <strong>pay for only what you need, when you need it</strong>,
          without any{" "}
          <strong>compromise in the quality, service delivery,</strong> or the{" "}
          <strong>appearance of your practice.</strong> You also have the extra
          advantage of enjoying the collegiality and support of an association
          with many other lawyers with similar practices, professional interests
          and professional experiences.
